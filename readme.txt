This is the readme file.

Please unzip this folder into D drive or if you have already unzipped it, then move it to D drive. This is to ensure that the GUI created runs without any issues. If there is no D drive available then this code will not execute. Sorry for that!!

Pre-requisites -
1. You must have your system able to run codes written in python language.
2. You must have MongoDB installed on your system.
3. You must have specific libraries installed in python on your system. To install them run the following commands in the command prompt where your python is installed.

pip install names
pip install dateutil
pip install tkinter
pip install pymongo
pip install datetime

Once done with this move on to the steps for execution below.

Steps for execution:
1. First ensure that the 'tickets' folder in the BUS_RESERVATION_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM folder is empty.
2. Then run the 'dataentry.py'. This will populate the database if available or first create it and then populate it. It would also add all the tickets generated into the 'tickets' folder. Hence you have to ensure the step 1.
3. Now run the 'main.py' file. This would start a GUI application. For admin login the password is 123.

NOTE: Do not run the 'dataentry.py' file more than once.

Thank you so much for your valuable time spent in reading this.
